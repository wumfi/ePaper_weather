# ePaper_weather - Micropython

Repo to store working code for my weather app on the Pico ePaper 3.7" e-ink display.

I'm using MPY rather than CPY as I couldn't find a decent library for CPY, and I don't yet have the skills to convert one.

I needed wifi to grab the weather, so I'm using a TinyS2 ESP32-S2 board instead.  I'll add in a wiring diagram soon.

E-ink library courtesy of https://github.com/phoreglad/pico-epaper <-- Who I am eternally grateful to!

The image convertor is part of the repo above, and the fonts convertor comes from https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py.
