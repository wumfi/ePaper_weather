# ePaper_weather - Micropython

Repo to store working code for my weather app on the Pico ePaper 3.7" e-ink display.  I'm using Micropython rather than Circuitpython as I couldn't find a decent library for cPY, and I don't yet have the skills to convert one.

I needed wifi to grab the weather, so I'm using a TinyS2 ESP32-S2 board instead.  I'll add in a wiring diagram soon.
